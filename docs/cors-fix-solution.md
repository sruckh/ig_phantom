# CORS Fix Solution for N8N Webhook

## Problem Identified

The frontend "Failed to fetch" error was caused by **CORS policy blocking**, not a timeout or parsing issue:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://n8n.gemneye.info/webhook/instagram-scraper' from origin 'https://igphantom.gemneye.info' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

The N8N webhook successfully generates the JSON response but doesn't include proper CORS headers, causing the browser to block the response from reaching the frontend JavaScript.

## Browser Console Evidence

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Request properly sent
üöÄ Starting webhook request at: 2025-08-22T07:24:32.449Z
üìç Webhook URL: https://n8n.gemneye.info/webhook/instagram-scraper
üì¶ Payload: {
  "url": "https://www.instagram.com/elena_fabricius/",
  "phantomApiKey": "rhy49GfsS5Yqx6tIdx9V5lIdBvwF40OF0XYGEiLtqaE",
  "agentId": "4314722279551667",
  // ... more payload
}

// ‚ùå CORS policy blocks response
Access to fetch at 'https://n8n.gemneye.info/webhook/instagram-scraper' from origin 'https://igphantom.gemneye.info' has been blocked by CORS policy

// ‚ùå Frontend never receives the successful JSON response
net::ERR_FAILED
```

## Solution: Configure CORS Headers in N8N

### Step 1: Update the "Respond to Webhook" Node

In your N8N workflow, edit the **"Respond to Webhook"** node and add these headers in the **Response Headers** section:

```json
{
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://igphantom.gemneye.info",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
  "Access-Control-Max-Age": "86400"
}
```

### Step 2: Handle OPTIONS Preflight Requests

Add a condition to handle OPTIONS requests before your main workflow:

1. Add an **IF** node after the webhook trigger
2. Condition: `{{ $node["Webhook"].json["httpMethod"] === "OPTIONS" }}`
3. True branch: Return early with CORS headers
4. False branch: Continue with your existing workflow

### Step 3: Alternative - Use Wildcard (Development Only)

For development/testing, you can use:
```json
{
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS, GET",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type"
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Don't use wildcard `*` in production!

## Verification Steps

After updating the N8N workflow:

1. **Test the webhook** - The browser console should now show:
   ```javascript
   üì° Response received after: [X] ms
   üìä Response status: 200
   ‚úÖ Response ok: true
   üìã Response headers: {
     "access-control-allow-origin": "https://igphantom.gemneye.info",
     "content-type": "application/json"
   }
   ```

2. **Successful JSON parsing** - Should see:
   ```javascript
   ‚úÖ JSON parsed successfully after: [X] ms
   üìä Parsed data structure: success, imageUrls, totalImages, timestamp
   ```

## Key Insights

1. **N8N workflow worked perfectly** - Generated correct JSON with 100 image URLs
2. **Browser blocked the response** - CORS policy prevented JavaScript from accessing it
3. **"Failed to fetch" was misleading** - The fetch succeeded, but CORS blocked access
4. **Frontend code is correct** - Will work perfectly once CORS headers are added
